## 🚀 Projects That I've Tackled

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[Climate Model Emulation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-IUepVye-bAXqH59E0wrKC0rqCS_5oHR/view?usp=sharing)** | Designed a hybrid TCN–LSTM–UNet model to accelerate climate modeling; ranked **Top-10 on Kaggle** with significant gains over baselines. |
| **[GPU Convolution Forward Pass (CSE 160)](https://docs-cse160.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PA6.html)** | Built an OpenCL-accelerated forward layer (from LeNet-5) to run inference on Fashion MNIST—optimizing GPU inference for performance-critical workloads. |
| **[CSE Card Collector](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group30/cse110-sp25-group30)** | A professor-themed card-collecting web app with a clicker-style mini-game, high test coverage, mobile responsiveness, and real-time gameplay. |
| **YouTube Video Classification** | Built ML classifiers (Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN) on a Kaggle dataset of YouTube metadata; achieved **87.8% accuracy** with KNN. |
| **Black & White Image Colorization** | Implemented grayscale-to-color pipeline using OpenCV’s pre-trained Caffe model; packaged for reproducible, user-friendly image colorization. |
| **Movie Preference Modeling (EM Algorithm)** | Applied Expectation–Maximization to latent user type modeling; implemented log-likelihood tracking and converged to stable clusters. |
| **Habitizer (Android App)** | Built a mobile app in Android Studio to help users build and track daily routines, with features for routine creation, editing, timers, persistence, and progress tracking; developed using Agile practices with BDD user stories and GitHub CI. |
| **[Nachos OS Projects (CSE 120)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp25/cse120-a/projects/)** | Implemented core features of operating systems, including **threading** (join, condition variables, rendezvous), **system calls** (file I/O, exec/join/exit), and **memory management** (demand paging, swap, clock algorithm). |
